# Work Done Till Now to Fix the Auth Issues

# Changes Made in Step 1: User-Specific Keys in LocalStorageKeyStorage

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\services\keyManagement\providers\LocalStorageKeyStorage.ts`

Enhanced the `LocalStorageKeyStorage` class to use user-specific key names in localStorage, fixing the issue where all users on the same browser shared the same encryption keys. Added a private `getKeyName(userId)` method that generates unique storage keys by combining the base prefix with the user ID. Updated `storeKeys()`, `fetchKeys()`, and `clearKeys()` methods to use these user-specific keys. Also added a new `cleanupStaleKeys(currentUserId)` method that removes any keys from previous users that might be lingering in localStorage, preventing data leakage between accounts and reducing storage bloat.

# Changes Made in Step 2: Enhanced Middleware Error Handling

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\supabase\middleware.ts`

Enhanced the session handling middleware with comprehensive error handling and validation to address 401 Unauthorized errors. Modified the `updateSession()` function to properly capture and handle errors from `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `supabase.auth.getUser()` calls. Implemented session validation to only attempt refreshing when a valid session exists. Added diagnostic response headers (`x-auth-session-status`, `x-auth-error`, `x-auth-user-id`) to help with debugging authentication issues. Implemented detailed console logging throughout the authentication flow to provide visibility into session state and potential failures. These improvements ensure that any authentication errors are properly caught and logged, and that the session refresh only happens when appropriate.

# Changes Made in Step 3: Improved Error Handling in Server.ts

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\supabase\server.ts`

Enhanced the error handling in the Supabase server client creation function to prevent silent failures of cookie operations that could cause authentication issues. Implemented a comprehensive error tracking system in the `setAll` method of the cookie handler by adding detailed error logging with the `console.error` function, specifically marking authentication-related cookie failures with warning indicators. Created a `cookieErrors` array to track all cookie operation failures and added a summary log that reports the total number of failed operations. This implementation ensures that any cookie-related authentication issues are properly logged and can be diagnosed, addressing potential causes of the 401 Unauthorized errors seen in new browser sessions.

# Changes Made in Step 5: Enhanced Key Management Service Initialization

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\services\keyManagement\useKeyManagement.ts`

Completely refactored the Key Management Service initialization logic to address race conditions and duplicate initialization attempts. Merged two separate useEffect hooks into a single, comprehensive initialization flow with clear sequential logic. Added prevention of concurrent initialization attempts with a local flag system, and improved handling of component unmounting during async operations. Enhanced error handling with detailed logging and proper cleanup. Implemented a robust ensureInitialized function with timeout handling to prevent infinite waiting. This more reliable initialization process helps address both authentication issues by ensuring the Key Management Service is properly initialized with the correct user-specific keys, preventing data leakage between user accounts and resolving timing issues that could lead to 401 errors.


# Changes Made in Step 6: Improved Logout Process

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\store\authStore.ts`

Significantly enhanced the `logout` function in the authentication store to ensure comprehensive cleanup of all user-specific data during logout. Implemented a multi-step cleanup process that: 1) stores the current user ID for reference, 2) explicitly clears the key management service, 3) cleans up user-specific localStorage keys using the `LocalStorageKeyStorage` provider's `cleanupStaleKeys` method, 4) clears the symmetric key from session storage, 5) signs out from Supabase, and 6) explicitly clears all auth state. Added verification checks to confirm that all user data is properly cleared after logout. Enhanced error handling throughout the process to ensure that non-fatal errors in individual steps don't prevent the overall logout operation from completing. This comprehensive cleanup prevents potential issues like data leakage between accounts and improves the reliability of subsequent login attempts.

# Changes Made in Step 4: Added Authentication for API Requests

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\fetchWithRetry.ts`

Created a new utility file providing robust retry logic for API calls, especially targeting 401 Unauthorized errors that occur when authentication is still initializing. Implemented the main `fetchWithRetry()` function with configurable retry count, delay between retries, and exponential backoff. Added special handling for 401 status codes which are common with authentication issues. The implementation includes detailed error handling and logging to assist with troubleshooting authentication problems.

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\authFetch.ts`

Created a new authentication-aware fetch utility that automatically adds the current Supabase authentication token to all API requests. The `authFetch()` function gets the current session token from Supabase and attaches it as an Authorization header to outgoing requests. Also implemented `authFetchJson<T>()` as a convenience method for fetching and parsing JSON responses with type safety. This ensures that all API calls include proper authentication information, addressing the root cause of the 401 errors.

## File: `c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\app\projects\page.tsx`

Updated the Projects page component to use the new `authFetch` and `authFetchJson` utilities instead of regular fetch calls. Modified the `fetchProjects()`, `handleCreateProject()`, and `handleDeleteProject()` methods to use authenticated fetch requests with retry capabilities. This ensures that API requests to fetch, create, and delete projects include the proper authentication token, preventing the 401 Unauthorized errors even when there are timing issues with authentication initialization.

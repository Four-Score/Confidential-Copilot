# Work Done Till Now for Chat Mode Implementation

## Step 1.1: Update Chat Mode Card in Dashboard
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added an onClick handler to the Chat Mode entry in the modes array to navigate to the chat page using Next.js router.

## Step 1.2: Create Chat Page Component
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Created a new page component for the chat interface with the following features:
  - Real-time message history display with different styles for user and assistant messages
  - Text input area with support for Enter key submission
  - Model selector dropdown with three predefined Groq models
  - New Chat button with confirmation dialog
  - Basic loading state indicator
  - Integration with the existing retrieval flow system that triggers automatically when no project is selected
  - Uses the existing DataSelection context to access project and document selections


## Step 2.1: ChatMessage Component
- **File**: `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Created a component to display both user and LLM messages with distinct styling. The component accepts a `message` prop with `role` ('user' or 'assistant') and `content` fields. It renders different avatar icons and styling based on the message role (blue background for user messages, white with border for assistant messages). The component handles multi-line text by splitting content on newline characters and preserving formatting.

## Step 2.2: ChatInput Component
- **File**: `src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Created a flexible input component for the chat interface that includes a resizable textarea and submit button. The component accepts `isLoading` and `onSubmit` props to control its behavior. Features include: auto-resizing textarea that grows with content (up to a maximum height), Enter key submission (preserving Shift+Enter for new lines), validation to prevent empty message submission, auto-focus when not in loading state, and a loading indicator on the submit button. The component manages its own input state while delegating submission handling to the parent.

## Step 2.3: ModelSelector Component
- **File**: `src/components/chat/ModelSelector.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Created a reusable dropdown component for selecting LLM models. It accepts three props: `models` (array of model objects with id and name), `selectedModel` (currently selected model ID), and `onModelChange` (callback function). The component renders a labeled select element styled with Tailwind CSS that displays the available models and handles selection changes through the provided callback. The component is designed to be easily integrated into the chat interface without managing its own state.

## Step 2.4: NewChatButton Component
- **File**: `src/components/chat/NewChatButton.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Created a button component for starting a new chat conversation. It accepts two props: `hasMessages` (boolean indicating if there are existing messages) and `onNewChat` (callback function). The component includes a confirmation dialog that appears only when there are existing messages to prevent accidental clearing of chat history. The button is styled with Tailwind CSS and includes a plus icon for better visual indication of its function. When clicked, it either directly triggers the onNewChat callback or first displays a confirmation dialog depending on the hasMessages prop.


## Step 3.1: ChatContext
- **File**: `src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Created a context provider to manage the chat state globally. The context stores an array of chat messages (with IDs, roles, content, timestamps, and optional context sources), the currently selected LLM model, loading state, and error information. The implementation provides functions to add messages, clear the chat history, set the model, and manage loading and error states. The context includes a list of available models as a constant (AVAILABLE_MODELS) for easy reference throughout the app. The `useChatContext` hook is provided to consume this context in components.

## Step 3.2: useChat Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/useChat.ts`
- **Implementation**: Created a custom hook that provides a high-level API for chat operations by combining the ChatContext with vector search functionality. This hook handles sending messages, which involves a two-step process: first performing vector search on the selected documents, then calling the LLM API with the search results as context. It manages the chat input state and provides functions for changing the selected model and starting a new chat. The hook abstracts away the complexity of the chat flow, making it easy to use in the chat page component. It includes placeholder implementations for context formatting and LLM API calls that will be detailed in later steps.

## Step 4.1: Integrate Project Selection Flow
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Enhanced the existing useEffect hook to properly manage the retrieval flow based on project and document selection. The code now handles three scenarios: 1) No project selected - starts the full retrieval flow, 2) Project selected but no documents - starts retrieval flow focusing on document selection, and 3) Both project and documents selected - initializes the chat interface. This ensures users must complete the document selection process before interacting with the chat.

## Step 4.2: Create Chat Initialization Function
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Added a new `initializeChat` function that sets up the chat interface after project and document selection is complete. This function clears any previous messages, ensures loading state is properly set, and adds a contextual welcome message showing the selected project name and number of documents. Also updated the `handleSubmit` function to check for proper project and document selections before allowing interaction, redirecting users to the retrieval flow if needed. These changes provide a smoother transition from the selection process to the chat interface with appropriate context.

## Step 5.1: Set Up Vector Search Hook in Chat
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Integrated the vector search functionality into the chat page by importing the `useVectorSearch` hook and using it within the `handleSubmit` function. The updated implementation performs a vector search when the user submits a query, using the selected project ID and document IDs. The search results are then formatted into a context string (using the utility from Step 5.2) and will eventually be sent to the LLM API. For now, a placeholder response is displayed along with the search results in expandable context cards below each assistant message. This implementation maintains the separation between vector search and LLM processing while ensuring that the chat interface can display both the response and its source context.

## Step 5.2: Create Result Processing Function
- **File**: `src/lib/chatUtils.ts` (newly created)
- **Implementation**: Created a utility file with three key functions: 1) `formatSearchResultsToContext` converts vector search results into a structured string for the LLM, organizing the information by document and including similarity scores and content excerpts; 2) `createLlmPromptWithContext` combines the formatted context with the user's query to create a complete prompt that guides the LLM to generate grounded, relevant responses; and 3) `truncateContextToTokenLimit` ensures the context doesn't exceed token limitations by intelligently truncating at natural breakpoints. These utilities prepare the vector search results for effective use in retrieval-augmented generation while maintaining a clean separation between the vector search and LLM components.

## Step 6.1: Groq API Route
- **File**: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- **Implementation**: Created a Next.js API route that serves as a proxy for the Groq API, securing the API key on the server side. The route accepts POST requests with a query, context, and optional model parameter. It uses the `createLlmPromptWithContext` function to combine the query and retrieved context into a structured prompt. The implementation handles error cases like missing API keys or failed API responses, and processes the Groq API response to extract just the generated text for the client. Security is maintained by keeping the API key server-side only and properly validating incoming requests.

## Step 6.2: Environment Variables and API Config
- **File 1**: `.env.local`
- **Implementation**: Added a secure environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY` to store the Groq API key, ensuring it's not exposed to clients.
- **File 2**: `src/config/apiConfig.ts`
- **Implementation**: Created a centralized configuration file for API-related constants, particularly focusing on Groq model options. The file exports an `API_CONFIG` object with model IDs and human-readable names, and a helper function `getAvailableModels()` that returns an array of model objects in a format ready for UI components. This configuration approach makes it easy to update or extend the available models without changing UI components.

## Step 6.3: Enhanced Chat Utilities
- **File**: `src/lib/chatUtils.ts`
- **Implementation**: Enhanced the existing utilities with two new functions: `createOptimizedContext` which intelligently processes search results to stay within token limits, and `createEnhancedPrompt` which creates a more structured prompt with explicit instructions for the LLM to provide grounded responses based only on the context provided. These functions improve the quality of RAG responses by ensuring relevant information is prioritized and the LLM adheres to the zero-trust principle of only using provided context rather than its general knowledge.

## Step 6.4: LLM API Integration
- **File**: `src/hooks/useChat.ts`
- **Implementation**: Updated the placeholder `callLlmApi` function to make actual API calls to the new chat endpoint. The function handles the fetch request, error states, and response processing, providing a clean interface for the chat components to interact with the LLM API without worrying about the implementation details. Error handling ensures that any API issues are properly caught and reported to the user.

## Step 7.1: Integrate Search Result Cards
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Updated the chat page to integrate the existing search result components with the message display. Enhanced the message interface to include `contextResults` which stores the vector search results associated with each assistant message. Modified the message rendering logic to display search results in an expandable container below assistant messages using the existing `SearchResults` component. This implementation provides users with transparent access to the source information that was used to generate the LLM's responses while maintaining a clean chat interface.

## Step 7.2: Create Result Container Component
- **File**: `src/components/chat/ChatResponseContainer.tsx` (newly created)
- **Implementation**: Created a dedicated component to handle the display of assistant responses alongside their context sources. The component takes the LLM-generated text, search results, query text, and various state flags as props, then renders a structured interface with the response content at the top and an expandable context section below. The context section uses a button toggle (rather than the HTML details element) for better styling control, and leverages the existing `SearchResults` component to display the actual search results. The component handles multiple states including loading and error conditions, and formats multiline text properly. This modular approach allows for consistent styling and behavior of assistant messages throughout the application.

## Step 8.1: Loading Indicator Component
- **File**: `src/components/chat/LoadingIndicator.tsx` (newly created)
- **Implementation**: Created a flexible loading indicator component that shows animated dots with customizable size and text. The component accepts three props: `text` for the loading message, `size` to control the visual scale (sm, md, lg), and `className` for additional styling. The animation uses CSS keyframes with staggered delays to create a wave-like pulsing effect. The component is fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes (aria-live="polite" and role="status") to ensure screen readers announce the loading state appropriately.

## Step 8.2: Error Handling Implementation
- **File 1**: `src/components/chat/ErrorMessage.tsx` (newly created)
- **Implementation**: Created a reusable error message component that displays a formatted error with an optional retry button. The component shows a red alert box with an exclamation icon and the error message, providing a consistent error display pattern across the application. It accepts `message`, `onRetry` callback function, and optional `className` props.

- **File 2**: Modified `src/components/chat/ChatResponseContainer.tsx`
- **Changes**: Updated the component to use the new LoadingIndicator and ErrorMessage components, improving the visual consistency of loading and error states in the chat interface.

- **File 3**: Modified `src/app/dashboard/chat/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added more comprehensive error handling and loading state display using the new components. Implemented a retry mechanism for recoverable errors while maintaining context of the current chat.

- **File 4**: Modified `src/hooks/useChat.ts`
- **Changes**: Enhanced the error handling logic in the sendMessage function to provide more specific error messages based on the error type, improving the user experience by giving clearer feedback about what went wrong and how to fix it.

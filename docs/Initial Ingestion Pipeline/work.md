SUMMARY OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE UP TILL NOW FOR THE Ingestion Pipeline PLAN

1. created tables for projects, data and vector_chunks of the data

2. Implemented Encryption Utilities: (c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\encryptionUtils.ts)
Key Implementation Details
Key Management:

The EncryptionService class integrates with your existing authentication system by using the symmetric key from authStore to encrypt the DCPE keys
DCPE keys are generated once, then encrypted and stored in localStorage
On subsequent sessions, the encrypted DCPE keys are retrieved and decrypted using the user's symmetric key
Encryption Functions:

encryptText: Standard encryption for document content
encryptMetadata: Deterministic encryption for metadata (allows exact matching while encrypted)
encryptVector: Specialized encryption for vector embeddings that preserves search capabilities
React Integration:

useEncryptionService hook provides a React-friendly way to access the encryption service
Automatically initializes when the symmetric key is available
Includes loading and error states for UI feedback
Automatically clears encryption state on logout
Standalone Utilities:

Functions like encryptText, encryptMetadata, and encryptVector can be used outside React components
Each function checks if the service is initialized and initializes it if needed

3. Created PDF Processing Utilities: (c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\pdfUtils.ts)
PDF Validation: validatePdfFile: Checks if a file is a PDF and within the 5MB size limit
Text Extraction: extractTextFromPdf: Extracts text and metadata from a PDF file using PDFLoader
Chunking: chunkText: Splits text into chunks with configurable size and overlap
Complete Processing Pipeline: processPdfFile: An end-to-end function that validates, extracts, and chunks a PDF file

The utilities are designed to work client-side, which aligns with zero-trust and client-side processing requirements. PDF extraction is performed entirely in the browser without sending the file to any server.

4. Vector Embedding Utilities Implementation (c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\embeddingUtils.ts)

Embedding Model Setup: createEmbeddingModel: Creates an instance of the MiniLM-L6-v2 model
Embedding Generation: generateEmbedding: Generates a single embedding for a text
generateBatchEmbeddings: Processes chunks in batches with progress tracking
Vector Processing: normalizeVector: Normalizes vectors for consistent similarity calculations, cosineSimilarity: Calculates similarity between two vectors
The utilities are designed to work entirely client-side, supporting zero-trust approach. The batch processing accommodates larger documents by breaking them into manageable chunks to avoid memory issues

5. Projects API Endpoints Implementation
(a) Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\route.ts
This code defines API routes for managing projects in a Next.js application using Supabase for authentication and database interactions. 
The `GET` handler retrieves a list of projects for the authenticated user, while the `POST` handler creates a new project. 
Both handlers use the Supabase client (`createClient`) to interact with the Supabase database, and they handle authentication checks, data validation,
and error responses. The API uses `next/server`'s `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` for request and response handling.

(b) Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\[id]\route.ts
This code defines API endpoints for managing projects in a Next.js application with Supabase authentication.
-   `verifyProjectAccess`: A helper function to verify if a project exists and belongs to the given user.
-   `GET`: Retrieves project details by ID.
-   `PATCH`: Updates project information (name, description).
-   `DELETE`: Deletes a project by ID (cascading deletion is assumed for related documents and vector chunks).

6. Document Upload API Implementation
(a) Document Validation API Route: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\documents\validate\route.ts
This code defines an API endpoint (`POST` in route.ts) in a Next.js application that validates a file upload. It uses Supabase for authentication and checks if the user has a valid session using `supabase.auth.getSession()`. The endpoint receives a file via `FormData`, checks if it's a PDF, and validates its size against `MAX_FILE_SIZE`. If the file passes validation, it returns a success response with file metadata; otherwise, it returns an error. The `createClient()` function initializes a Supabase client with cookie handling for server-side operations.

(b) Document Upload API Route: 
Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\[projectId]\documents\route.ts
This code defines two API endpoints in route.ts for handling documents within a project. The `POST` function handles document uploads, taking `id` from the route parameters. It authenticates the user, verifies project ownership, and then inserts the document metadata and chunks into the Supabase database. If chunk insertion fails, it attempts to delete the document. The `GET` function retrieves a list of documents for a given `id`, also ensuring user authentication and project ownership. Both functions use the `createClient` function to initialize a Supabase client and return appropriate JSON responses with error handling.

(c) Document Metadata API Route: 
Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\documents\[id]\route.ts
This code defines two API endpoints for handling document-specific operations in a Next.js application using Supabase for database interactions and authentication. The `GET` function retrieves document details and metadata based on the document ID, verifying user authentication and ownership before returning the document's metadata, including the project name and chunk count. The `DELETE` function removes a document and its associated chunks, also ensuring user authentication and ownership before performing the deletion. Both functions handle potential errors and return appropriate JSON responses.

(d) Document Upload Progress API Route: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\documents\progress\route.ts
This code defines an API route (`route.ts`) in a Next.js application for tracking the progress of document uploads. It uses Supabase for authentication and stores progress information in an in-memory object `progressStore`. The `POST` method updates the progress, status, and any error messages associated with a given `uploadId`. The `GET` method retrieves the progress data for a specific `uploadId`. The `cleanupOldEntries` function periodically removes old entries from the `progressStore` to prevent memory leaks. The `createClient` function initializes a Supabase client with cookie handling for server-side operations, ensuring that user sessions are maintained. The Supabase client is then used to call `getSession` to ensure the user is authenticated.

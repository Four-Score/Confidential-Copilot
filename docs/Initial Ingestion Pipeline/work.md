# SUMMARY OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE UP TILL NOW FOR THE Ingestion Pipeline PLAN

## BACKEND

1. Created tables for projects, data and vector_chunks of the data
(a) Projects Table: 
*   Fields: `id` (primary key, UUID), `name` (project name), `user_id` (foreign key referencing the `auth.users` table), `created_at` (timestamp), and `description`.
*   Constraints: Ensures each user has unique project names via a `UNIQUE` constraint.
*   Indexes: Creates an index on `user_id` for faster queries.
*   Row Level Security (RLS): Implements policies to ensure users can only access projects they own.
*   Permissions: Grants all privileges on the table to authenticated users.

(b) Documents Table:
Purpose: Stores metadata and encrypted content for user-uploaded documents (PDFs, links, videos) within a project.
*   Key Fields:
    - `id`: UUID, primary key, auto-generated using gen_random_uuid().
    - `project_id`: UUID, foreign key referencing the projects table, with cascading delete enabled.
    - `name`: TEXT, stores the deterministically encrypted name of the document.
    - `type`: document_type, an ENUM with possible values: pdf, link, video.
    - `upload_date`: TIMESTAMPTZ, timestamp with timezone, defaults to the current time.
    - `encrypted_content`: TEXT, stores the standard encrypted content of the document.
    - `encrypted_metadata`: JSONB, stores deterministically encrypted metadata in JSON format.
    - `file_size`: INTEGER, stores the file size in bytes.
    - `page_count`: INTEGER, stores the page count (specifically for PDF documents).
*   Relationships: Foreign key relationship with the `projects` table, ensuring cascading deletes.
*   Security:
    -   Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access documents within their own projects.
    -   Data is stored encrypted.
*   Indexes: Index on `project_id` for efficient queries.

(c) Vector Chunks Table:
*   `id`: UUID, primary key, unique identifier for each chunk.
*   `document_id`: UUID, foreign key referencing the `documents` table, ensures each chunk belongs to a document.
*   `chunk_number`: INTEGER, the index of the chunk within the document.
*   `encrypted_chunk_content`: TEXT, stores the standard encrypted content of the chunk.
*   `encrypted_embeddings`: VECTOR(384), stores the encrypted vector embeddings of the chunk, using the pgvector extension.
*   `metadata`: JSONB, stores deterministically encrypted metadata about the chunk (e.g., page number, position).

The schema includes indexes for performance and Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data access is controlled based on the user's documents. A function `match_document_chunks` is provided to perform similarity searches on the encrypted embeddings.

(d) insert_document_with_chunks function:
The provided SQL function `insert_document_with_chunks` is designed to atomically insert a document and its associated chunks into the database. It takes parameters such as `project_id`, `name`, `type`, `file_size`, `page_count`, `encrypted_content`, `encrypted_metadata`, and `chunks` (a JSON array). The function first inserts the document metadata into the `documents` table and then iterates through the `chunks` JSON array, inserting each chunk into the `vector_chunks` table. The function uses a transaction to ensure that either all operations succeed, or none do, and returns a JSON object indicating success or failure. It also grants execute permission to authenticated users.

2. Implemented Encryption Utilities: (c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\encryptionUtils.ts)
Key Implementation Details
Key Management:

The EncryptionService class integrates with your existing authentication system by using the symmetric key from authStore to encrypt the DCPE keys
DCPE keys are generated once, then encrypted and stored in localStorage
On subsequent sessions, the encrypted DCPE keys are retrieved and decrypted using the user's symmetric key
Encryption Functions:

encryptText: Standard encryption for document content
encryptMetadata: Deterministic encryption for metadata (allows exact matching while encrypted)
encryptVector: Specialized encryption for vector embeddings that preserves search capabilities
React Integration:

useEncryptionService hook provides a React-friendly way to access the encryption service
Automatically initializes when the symmetric key is available
Includes loading and error states for UI feedback
Automatically clears encryption state on logout
Standalone Utilities:

Functions like encryptText, encryptMetadata, and encryptVector can be used outside React components
Each function checks if the service is initialized and initializes it if needed

3. Created PDF Processing Utilities: (c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\pdfUtils.ts)
This file, pdfUtils.ts, provides utilities for processing PDF files. It includes functions to `validatePdfFile` by checking its type and size, `extractTextFromPdf` to extract text and metadata, `chunkText` to divide the extracted text into smaller chunks, and `processPdfFile` to perform the complete PDF processing pipeline. It also defines interfaces `PDFExtractionResult` and `DocumentChunk` to structure the extracted data and chunks. Constants like `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE`, and `DEFAULT_CHUNK_OVERLAP` define limits and default values for file processing.

4. Vector Embedding Utilities Implementation (c:\Projects\Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\embeddingUtils.ts)

Embedding Model Setup: createEmbeddingModel: Creates an instance of the MiniLM-L6-v2 model
Embedding Generation: generateEmbedding: Generates a single embedding for a text
generateBatchEmbeddings: Processes chunks in batches with progress tracking
Vector Processing: normalizeVector: Normalizes vectors for consistent similarity calculations, cosineSimilarity: Calculates similarity between two vectors
The utilities are designed to work entirely client-side, supporting zero-trust approach. The batch processing accommodates larger documents by breaking them into manageable chunks to avoid memory issues

5. Projects API Endpoints Implementation
(a) Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\route.ts
This code defines API routes for managing projects in a Next.js application using Supabase for authentication and database interactions. 
The `GET` handler retrieves a list of projects for the authenticated user, while the `POST` handler creates a new project. 
Both handlers use the Supabase client (`createClient`) to interact with the Supabase database, and they handle authentication checks using `supabase.auth.getUser()` for improved security, data validation,
and error responses. The API uses `next/server`'s `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` for request and response handling. The POST endpoint also includes validation to prevent creation of duplicate project names for the same user.

(b) Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\[id]\route.ts
This code defines API endpoints for managing projects in a Next.js application with Supabase authentication.
-   `verifyProjectAccess`: A helper function to verify if a project exists and belongs to the given user.
-   `GET`: Retrieves project details by ID, using `supabase.auth.getUser()` for secure authentication.
-   `PATCH`: Updates project information (name, description).
-   `DELETE`: Deletes a project by ID (cascading deletion is assumed for related documents and vector chunks).

6. Document Upload API Implementation
(a) Document Validation API Route: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\documents\validate\route.ts
This code defines an API endpoint (`POST` in route.ts) in a Next.js application that validates a file upload. It uses Supabase for authentication and checks if the user has a valid session using `supabase.auth.getUser()`. The endpoint receives a file via `FormData`, checks if it's a PDF, and validates its size against `MAX_FILE_SIZE`. If the file passes validation, it returns a success response with file metadata; otherwise, it returns an error. The `createClient()` function initializes a Supabase client with cookie handling for server-side operations.

(b) Document Upload API Route: 
Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\[projectId]\documents\route.ts
This code defines two API endpoints in route.ts for handling documents within a project. The `POST` function handles document uploads, taking `id` from the route parameters. It authenticates the user using `supabase.auth.getUser()`, verifies project ownership, and then properly uses the `insert_document_with_chunks` database function to insert both the document metadata and its chunks in a single transaction. This ensures data is atomically saved to both the `documents` and `vector_chunks` tables. The `GET` function retrieves a list of documents for a given `id`, also ensuring user authentication and project ownership. Both functions use the `createClient` function to initialize a Supabase client and return appropriate JSON responses with error handling.

(c) Document Retrieval API Route:
Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\projects\[id]\documents\[documentId]\route.ts
This code defines an API endpoint for retrieving a specific document within a project context. It authenticates the user, verifies project ownership, and checks that the document belongs to the specified project. The endpoint returns document metadata including the document ID, name, type, upload date, and chunk count. This API route is particularly important for retrieving document details immediately after upload.

(d) Document Metadata API Route: 
Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\documents\[id]\route.ts
This code defines two API endpoints for handling document-specific operations in a Next.js application using Supabase for database interactions and authentication. The `GET` function retrieves document details and metadata based on the document ID, verifying user authentication using `supabase.auth.getUser()` and ownership before returning the document's metadata, including the project name and chunk count. The `DELETE` function removes a document and its associated chunks, also ensuring user authentication and ownership before performing the deletion. Both functions handle potential errors and return appropriate JSON responses.

(e) Document Upload Progress API Route: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\documents\progress\route.ts
This code defines an API route (`route.ts`) in a Next.js application for tracking the progress of document uploads. It uses Supabase for authentication and stores progress information in an in-memory object `progressStore`. The `POST` method updates the progress, status, and any error messages associated with a given `uploadId`. The `GET` method retrieves the progress data for a specific `uploadId`. The `cleanupOldEntries` function periodically removes old entries from the `progressStore` to prevent memory leaks. The `createClient` function initializes a Supabase client with cookie handling for server-side operations, ensuring that user sessions are maintained. The Supabase client is then used to call `supabase.auth.getUser()` to ensure the user is authenticated.

7. Processing Pipeline API Implementation
(a) Processing Start API Endpoint: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\processing\start\route.ts
This code defines an API endpoint (`POST` in route.ts) in a Next.js application to initiate document processing. It uses Supabase for authentication and database interactions. The `POST` function first checks if the user is authenticated using `supabase.auth.getUser()`. If authenticated, it parses the request body to extract `projectId` and `fileName`, validates their presence, and verifies that the project exists and belongs to the user by querying the `projects` table. A unique `jobId` is generated, and the function returns this `jobId` along with a status message to the client. Error handling is included to return appropriate HTTP status codes for authentication failures, missing parameters, project not found, and other server errors.

(b) Processing Status API Endpoint: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\processing\status\[jobId]\route.ts
This code defines a `GET` function in route.ts that serves as an API endpoint to check the status of a document processing job, identified by `jobId`. It initializes a Supabase client, verifies user authentication via `supabase.auth.getUser()`, and then makes an internal `fetch` request to the `/api/documents/progress` endpoint, passing the `jobId` as an `uploadId` parameter. If the internal request is successful, it returns the status data as a JSON response; otherwise, it returns an error. Error handling is included to catch any exceptions during the process.

(c) Processing Cancel API Endpoint: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\api\processing\cancel\[jobId]\route.ts
This code defines a Next.js API endpoint (`POST` at `/api/documents/cancel/[jobId]`) to cancel a document processing job. It extracts the `jobId` from the URL parameters, initializes a Supabase client using `createClient()`, and verifies user authentication via `supabase.auth.getUser()`. Upon successful authentication, it sends a `POST` request to `/api/documents/progress` to update the job's status to 'cancelled'. The function returns a JSON response indicating success or failure, along with appropriate HTTP status codes. Error handling is included to catch and log any exceptions during the cancellation process.

(d) Create a Client-Side Processing Utility: Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\processingUtils.ts
This code defines a client-side document processing pipeline in processingUtils.ts for a React/TypeScript application. It includes functions to handle PDF processing, embedding generation, encryption, and interaction with a backend API. The `processPdfDocument` function orchestrates the entire process: it extracts text from a PDF using `processPdfFile`, generates embeddings using `generateBatchEmbeddings`, encrypts the data using functions from `encryptionUtils` (like `encryptText`, `encryptMetadata`, and `encryptVector`), and uploads the encrypted data to the server. Helper functions like `initiateProcessingJob`, `updateProcessingProgress`, and `cancelProcessingJob` manage the communication with the backend to track and control the processing job. The code also defines types and interfaces such as `ProcessingStatus`, `ProcessingProgressEvent`, and `ProcessingOptions` to manage the state and configuration of the document processing pipeline.
Implementation Notes:
Zero-Trust Processing Model:
- All document processing happens client-side
- PDF extraction, chunking, embedding generation, and encryption all happen in the - rowser
- Server only coordinates and stores the encrypted results
- This maintains the security-by-design principle
API Endpoints:
- `/api/processing/start`: Initiates a processing job
- `/api/processing/status/[jobId]`: Checks the status of a processing job
- `/api/processing/cancel/[jobId]`: Cancels a processing job
Client-Side Processing Utility:
- `processingUtils.ts`: Coordinates the complete document processing workflow
- Handles step-by-step processing with progress tracking
- Provides cancellation support for long-running operations
Progress Tracking:
- Reuses the existing progress tracking system
- Provides detailed status updates for each processing phase
- Allows for progress visualization in the UI
Error Handling:
- Comprehensive error handling at each stage
- Proper error reporting to both the client and the progress tracking system

## FRONTEND

This code defines the `DashboardPage` component in page.tsx, which fetches and displays a list of projects. It uses React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage the component's state, including the list of `projects`, loading state (`isLoading`), error messages (`error`), and modal visibility (`isModalOpen`). The `fetchProjects` function fetches project data from the `/api/projects` endpoint and updates the `projects` state. The component also includes functions to handle project creation (`handleCreateProject`) and deletion (`handleDeleteProject`). It renders a `ProjectList` component to display the projects, a `CreateProjectModal` for creating new projects, and an `EmptyState` component when there are no projects. The projects can be sorted and filtered using the search bar and sort buttons.

(b) Project Types Definition: Confidential-Copilot\src\types\project.ts
The code defines a TypeScript interface named `Project`. This interface is a type declaration that outlines the structure of a project object. It specifies that a `Project` object will have the following properties: `id` (a string), `name` (a string), an optional `description` (a string or undefined), `created_at` (a string), and `user_id` (a string). 

(c) Project Card Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\dashboard\ProjectCard.tsx
ProjectCard.tsx is a React component in a Next.js application that displays project information. It receives a `project` object and a `onDelete` function as props. The component shows the project's name, creation date, and description. It includes a delete button that, when clicked, opens a confirmation popup. The `handleDelete` function is called upon confirmation, which calls the `onDelete` prop function to delete the project. The card navigates to the project's detail page when clicked, handled by the `handleCardClick` function.

(d) Project List Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\dashboard\ProjectList.tsx
`ProjectList` is a React component that renders a grid of `ProjectCard` components, each displaying project information and providing a delete button, using data passed in the `projects` prop and calling the `onDeleteProject` prop function when a project is deleted.

(e) Create Project Modal Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\dashboard\CreateProjectModal.tsx
The code defines a `CreateProjectModal` React component, which presents a modal dialog for creating new projects. It includes state management for the project's `name` and `description`, handles form submission via the `handleSubmit` function, displays errors, and communicates with a parent component through the `onCreateProject` prop to create the project.

(f) Empty State Component:
Confidential-Copilot\src\components\dashboard\EmptyState.tsx
The `EmptyState` component in EmptyState.tsx renders a UI element displayed when the user has no projects, prompting them to create one using the `onCreateProject` function.

2. Project Page Implementation
(a) Project Page Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\app\projects\[id]\page.tsx
The `ProjectPage` component fetches and displays project details and documents. It uses `fetchProjectData` to retrieve data, handles document uploads with `handleUploadComplete`, and manages document deletion with `handleDeleteDocument`. It also decrypts document names using the `encryptionService` when available. The component has been updated to correctly handle the API response structure for project data.

(b) Document Type Definition: Confidential-Copilot\src\types\document.ts
The code defines a TypeScript interface `Document` representing a document's structure, including fields like `id`, `project_id`, `name`, `type`, `upload_date`, `file_size`, `page_count`, and `encrypted_metadata`.

(c) Project Header Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\projects\ProjectHeader.tsx
The `ProjectHeader` component displays project information (name, description, creation date) and an upload button. It allows users to edit the project's name and description using a form that calls the `handleSubmit` function to send updates to the server via a PATCH request to `/api/projects/${project.id}`. The component uses state variables (`isEditing`, `name`, `description`, `isSubmitting`, `error`) to manage the editing state and form inputs. The `onUploadClick` prop is a callback function triggered when the "Upload Document" button is clicked.

(d) Document List Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\documents\DocumentList.tsx
`DocumentList` component displays, filters, and sorts a list of documents with search and sort functionalities, rendering each document as a `DocumentCard`.

(e) Document Card Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\documents\DocumentCard.tsx
*   DocumentCard.tsx: This React component displays document details like name, upload date, type, and size, and includes a delete confirmation feature.
*   `formatFileSize`: This function converts a file size in bytes to a human-readable format (bytes, KB, or MB).

3. File Upload Components Implementation
(a) FileUploader Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\uploads\FileUploader.tsx
This code defines a `FileUploader` component in `src/components/uploads/FileUploader.tsx` that allows users to upload files, specifically PDFs. It handles file validation (type and size), drag-and-drop functionality, displays upload progress, and shows error messages. The component uses React hooks like `useState`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` to manage its state and behavior. It also provides options for canceling the upload and displaying the selected file's information.

(b) Progress Bar Component: 
Confidential-Copilot\src\components\uploads\ProgressBar.tsx
This React functional component, `ProgressBar`, renders a customizable progress bar with optional percentage text, ensuring the progress value stays between 0-100, and allows styling via props for color, height, and visibility of the percentage.

(c) Error Display Component:
Confidential-Copilot\src\components\uploads\ErrorDisplay.tsx
This React functional component, `ErrorDisplay`, takes an error message and an optional CSS class as props, and conditionally renders a styled error alert box with an icon if the error message exists.

(d) PDF File Preview Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\uploads\PDFPreview.tsx
This React component, `PDFPreview`, generates a preview of a PDF file using a blob URL, displays it in an `<object>` element, and provides a fallback message with a link if the preview fails, while cleaning up the blob URL on unmount.

(e) Document Uploader Component: Confidential-Copilot\src\components\documents\DocumentUploader.tsx
DocumentUploader.tsx is a React component that handles the uploading and processing of documents, specifically PDFs, in a secure manner. It uses several custom hooks and components to achieve this: `useEncryptionService` for encryption, `useDocumentProcessor` for handling the file processing pipeline, `FileUploader` for the drag-and-drop file selection, and `PDFPreview` for displaying a preview of the selected PDF. The component manages the file selection via `handleFileSelect`, initiates the upload process with `startUpload` which calls `processFile` from the `useDocumentProcessor` hook, and allows canceling the upload via `handleCancelUpload`. It also displays progress and status updates during the upload and processing stages, ensuring a secure, client-side processing workflow.

## Client-Side Processing 

8. Client-Side Processing Implementation
(a) Create Enhanced Client-Side Processing Configuration File: Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\processingConfig.ts
This code defines a configuration interface `PDFProcessingConfig` for PDF processing, provides a default configuration, and a function to override the default configuration with user-provided values.

(b) Create a Comprehensive Client-Side Processing Module: Confidential-Copilot\src\lib\clientProcessing.ts
The `processDocument` function orchestrates a client-side document processing pipeline: It validates and extracts data from a PDF using `validatePdfFile` and `processPdfFile`, generates embeddings using `generateBatchEmbeddings`, encrypts the content and metadata using `encryptText`, `encryptMetadata`, and `encryptVector` from `dcpe-js`, reports progress using `initiateProcessingJob`, `updateProcessingProgress`, and uploads the encrypted data to a server endpoint. It handles errors and cancellations, and returns a `ProcessingResult` indicating success or failure.

(c) Create a Custom Hook for Client-Side Processing: Confidential-Copilot\src\hooks\useDocumentProcessor.ts
The `useDocumentProcessor` hook manages the document processing workflow. It uses `useState` to track the processing status, progress, errors, and `symmetricKey` from `useAuthStore`. The `processFile` function is the core logic, taking a `projectId` and a `File` object as input. It calls `processDocument` to handle the actual processing, which includes validation, text extraction using `processPdfFile`, embedding generation using `generateBatchEmbeddings`, encryption, and uploading to the server. Throughout the process, `reportProgress` updates the UI, and error handling ensures that failures are caught and reported.

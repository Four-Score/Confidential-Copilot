### Role of the Email Assistant Extension

The **Email Assistant Extension** is a browser-based tool designed to streamline email management by summarizing email content and generating responses based on customizable prompts. Below is a detailed explanation of its functionality, workflow, and components based on the provided codebase.

---

### 1. **Core Functionality**
The extension performs the following tasks:

#### a. **Email Content Fetching**
- The extension uses the **Email API** (e.g., Gmail API) to fetch email content, including the subject, body, and metadata.
- This is handled by the `GmailApiService.ts` located in the `services/` folder.

#### b. **Summarization**
- The fetched email content is summarized using **GROQ** (Graph-Relational Object Queries).
- The summarization logic is implemented in the `EntityAnalyzer.ts` and `EmailExtractor.ts` files under the `core/` folder. These components extract key entities and summarize the email content into concise information.

#### c. **Customizable Prompt for Response Generation**
- The summarized email content is passed to a **customizable prompt** that allows users to define the tone, length, and additional notes for the response.
- The **LLMService.ts** in the `services/` folder interacts with a language model (likely an LLM like GPT) to generate the response based on the prompt.

#### d. **Save to Dashboard**
- When the user clicks the "Save to Dashboard" button, the extension sends the generated summary and response to a backend API.
- This is handled by the `ApiService.ts` and `EmailModeUploader.ts` in the `services/` folder.

### 2. **Workflow**
Here’s how the extension operates step-by-step:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user opens an email in their browser.
   - The extension's content script (`content.tsx`) injects itself into the email platform (e.g., Gmail) to extract the email content.

2. **Email Extraction**:
   - The `EmailExtractor.ts` identifies and extracts the email's subject, body, and metadata.
   - The extracted data is passed to the `EntityAnalyzer.ts` for summarization.

3. **Summarization**:
   - The summarization process uses GROQ to extract key entities (e.g., sender, recipient, dates, and action items) and condenses the email content into a summary.

4. **Prompt Customization**:
   - The summarized content is displayed in the extension's popup UI (`popup.tsx`).
   - The user customizes the response by selecting options like tone, length, and adding notes.

5. **Response Generation**:
   - The `LLMService.ts` sends the customized prompt to a language model (e.g., GPT) to generate a response.
   - The generated response is displayed in the popup for review.

6. **Save to Dashboard**:
   - When the user clicks "Save to Dashboard," the `ApiService.ts` sends the summary and response to the backend API for storage.

### 3. **Key Components**

#### a. **Core Logic**
- **`EmailExtractor.ts`**:
  - Extracts raw email content from the email platform.
  - Identifies key sections like subject, body, and metadata.

- **`EntityAnalyzer.ts`**:
  - Analyzes the extracted content to identify entities (e.g., names, dates, tasks).
  - Summarizes the email content into actionable insights.

- **`ResponseGenerator.ts`**:
  - Prepares the summarized content for the customizable prompt.
  - Works with the `LLMService.ts` to generate a response.

#### b. **Services**
- **`GmailApiService.ts`**:
  - Handles communication with the Gmail API to fetch email content.
  - Manages authentication and API requests.

- **`LLMService.ts`**:
  - Sends the customizable prompt to a language model (e.g., GPT) and retrieves the generated response.

- **`ApiService.ts`**:
  - Sends the summarized content and generated response to the backend API when the user saves it to the dashboard.

- **`EmailModeUploader.ts`**:
  - Handles file uploads (e.g., attachments) related to the email.

#### c. **UI Components**
- **`popup.tsx`**:
  - The main UI for the extension, allowing users to view the summary, customize the prompt, and generate responses.

- **`styles.css`**:
  - Provides styling for the popup and other UI elements.

#### d. **Manifest File**
- **`manifest.json`**:
  - Defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and entry points.
  - Specifies the content script (`content.tsx`) and background script (`background.js`).

### 4. **Extension Workflow Diagram**
Here’s a simplified diagram of the extension’s workflow:

```
[User Opens Email] --> [Content Script Injected] --> [Email Extractor]
       --> [Entity Analyzer] --> [Summarized Content]
       --> [Popup UI] --> [Customizable Prompt]
       --> [LLM Service] --> [Generated Response]
       --> [Save to Dashboard] --> [API Service]
```

### 5. **Key Features**
- **Email Summarization**:
  - Extracts and condenses email content into actionable summaries.
- **Customizable Prompts**:
  - Allows users to define tone, length, and additional notes for responses.
- **Response Generation**:
  - Uses a language model to generate responses based on the customized prompt.
- **Save to Dashboard**:
  - Sends summaries and responses to a backend API for storage and later use.

### 6. **How the Extension Was Unpacked**
- The extension was built using Webpack (`webpack.config.js`) and output to the `dist/` folder.
- The `dist.crx` file is the packaged extension, and the `dist.pem` file is the private key used for signing.
- The unpacked extension was loaded into Chrome via the **Load Unpacked** option in `chrome://extensions/`.
